  * Using upstream checkout 43ea2cdf4a8cec7c1c1b9827046e71258b77008f
    instead of the latest release, since there were few fixes introduced
    since the release
  * Due to upstream switch to git, remake git repository now contains
    sources for vanilla make, remake, and Debian packaging.
  * Added VCS fields into the header.
  * Extended list of copyright holders due to added pieces.
  * Not using dpatch any longer.
  * Redoing DFSG compliance of a new remake:

      and FDL license is no longer shipped
    - remake-specific info file is no longer present/shipped
    - vanilla make changelog is no longer shipped separate,
      please refer to /usr/share/doc/make/changelog.gz which contains
      entries for both make and remake
  * Updated compliance to policy 3.8.0
  * Using autotools at package build time, it required also custom clean
    up in clean rule of debian/rules
